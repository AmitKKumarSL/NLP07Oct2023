text = "The EV market in India has distinct features. EV adoption is being driven by the mass market, primarily two-wheelers, and threewheelers to an extent. Between them, they account for about 96% of the EV market. Among EV two-wheelers, the aggressive early entrants have generally been new entrants to the automobile sector. Combine this fact with two other features of the EV market. Batteries, the heart of EVs, are sourced through imports. Advanced chemistry cells are sourced entirely from abroad."
